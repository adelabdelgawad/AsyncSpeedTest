# AsyncSpeedtest

[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7%2B-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A Python script to perform asynchronous internet speed tests using the `aiohttp` library. This tool measures download and upload speeds and finds the best server for testing based on latency.

## Features

- üåê Asynchronous speed testing
- üöÄ Measures download and upload speeds
- üîç Finds the best server based on latency
- üêç Compatible with Python 3.7 and above
- üõ†Ô∏è Optional debug logging for detailed insights

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adelabdegawad/async-speedtest.git
    cd async-speedtest
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    This will start the asynchronous speed test, find the best server, and measure the download and upload speeds.

## Example Output

```plaintext
Testing internet speed...
Finding best server...
Best server: Server Name, Country (ID: server_id)
Starting download test...
Starting upload test...
Download speed: 100.00 Mbps
Upload speed: 50.00 Mbps
```

## Code Overview

The main components of the script are:

- **AsyncSpeedtest Class:**
    - `fetch`: Asynchronous method to fetch data from a URL.
    - `calculate_distance`: Calculates the distance between two geographic coordinates.
    - `get_best_server`: Finds the best server based on latency.
    - `measure_download_speed`: Measures download speed by fetching large chunks of data.
    - `measure_upload_speed`: Measures upload speed by sending large chunks of data.

- **run_speedtest Function:**
    - Initializes the `AsyncSpeedtest` class.
    - Finds the best server.
    - Measures download and upload speeds.
    - Prints the results.
